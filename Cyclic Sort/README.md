#### Useful approach for dealing with problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range.

We are given an array containing n objects. Each object, when created, was assigned a unique number from the range 1 to n based on their creation sequence. 

Write a function to sort this array in-place in O(n) time without using extra-space. In this example array contains only the sequence numbers (from 1 to n)
